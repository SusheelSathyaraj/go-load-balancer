## Requirements

- Go 1.16 or higher
- Compatible with any backend server pool

## Installation

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SusheelSathyaraj/go-load-balancer.git
cd go-load-balancer

go mod tidy
```

## Usage

- Configure Backend Servers: Update config.yaml to specify the servers for load balancing.
- Run the Load Balancer: Execute the following command to start the load balancer:

```bash
  go run *.go -> to run all the .go extension files at once
```
- Access Logs and Monitoring: Check logs in the logs/ folder for detailed information on traffic distribution and health checks.

## Configuration

Modify the config.yaml file to specify server details and health check intervals. Example:

```yaml
servers:
  - address: http://server1.com
  - address: http://server2.com
healthCheckInterval: 10s
loadBalancingAlgorithm: round-robin and least connections
```

## Load Balancing Algorithms

- Round-robin: Distributes requests sequentially among servers.
- Least Connections: Directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
